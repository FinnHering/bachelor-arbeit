  abstract = {Modern scientific research challenges require new technologies, integrated tools, reusable and complex experiments in distributed computing infrastructures. But above all, computing power for efficient data processing and analyzing. Containers technologies have emerged as a new paradigm to address such intensive scientific applications problems. Their easy deployment in a reasonable amount of time and the few required computational resource make them more suitable. Containers are considered light virtualization solutions. They enable performance isolation and flexible deployment of complex, parallel, and high-performance systems. Moreover, they gained popularity to modernize and migrate scientific applications in computing infrastructure management. Additionally, they reduce computational time processing. In this paper, we first give an overview of virtualization and containerization technologies. We discuss the taxonomies of containerization technologies of the literature, and then we provide a new one that covers and completes those proposed in the literature. We identify the most important application domains of containerization and their technological progress. Furthermore, we discuss the performance metrics used in most containerization techniques. Finally, we point out research gaps in the related aspects of containerization technology that require more research.},

We present our experience with the same since 2015 in CS50 at Harvard University as well as the pedagogical and operational motivations therefor. We present, too, the evolution of our environments for students over the years, from an on-campus cluster, to an off-campus cloud, to client-side virtual machines, to Docker containers, discussing the trade-offs of each. Not only do containers provide students with a standardized environment, reducing technical difficulties and frequently asked questions at term's start, they also provide instructors with full control over the software in use and versions thereof, additionally allowing instructors to deploy updates mid-semester. Particularly for large courses with hundreds or even thousands of students, containers allow staff to focus more of their time on teaching than on technical support. And, coupled with text editors that support extensions or plugins, containers allow instructors to optimize students' environment for learning, while still acquainting students with industry-standard tools. Most recently implemented atop GitHub Codespaces, a cloud-based version of Visual Studio Code, our own container-based solutions have since been used by more than 700,000 students and teachers, both on campus and off, and are also freely available to any teacher or student outside of our own university.},

The main advantage is that, Docker can get code tested and deployed into production as fast as possible. Different applications can be run over Docker containers with language independency. In this paper the performance of these Docker containers are evaluated based on their system performance. That is based on system resource utilization. Different benchmarking tools are used for this. Performance based on file system is evaluated using Bonnie++. Other system resources such as CPU utilization, memory utilization etc. are evaluated based on the benchmarking code (using psutil) developed using python. Detail results obtained from all these tests are also included in this paper. The results include CPU utilization, memory utilization, CPU count, CPU times, Disk partition, network I/O counter etc.},

  abstract = {In-situ data analysis and visualization is a promising technique to handle the enormous amount of data an extreme-scale application produces. One challenge users often face in adopting in-situ techniques is setting the right environment on a target machine. Platforms such as SENSEI require complex software stacks that consist of various analysis packages and visualization applications. The user has to make sure all these prerequisites exist on the target machine, which often involves compiling and setting them up from scratch. In this paper, we leverage the containers technology (e.g., light-weight virtualization images) and provide users with Singularity containers that encapsulate ready-to-use, movable in-situ software stacks. Moreover, we make use of Spack to ease the process of creating these containers. Finally, we evaluate this solution by running in-situ analysis from within a container on an HPC system.},

  abstract = {Docker has gained significant popularity in recent years. With the introduction of Docker Desktop for Windows and macOS, there is a need to determine the impact of the operating system on the performance of the Docker platform. This paper aims to investigate the performance of Docker containers based on the operating system. One of the fundamental goals of this study is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the Docker architecture. This technology utilizes Linux kernel virtualization mechanisms such as namespaces and cgroups. Upon analyzing the distribution of Docker Desktop for Windows and Docker Desktop for macOS, it was discovered that running the Docker environment on these requires a lightweight virtual machine that emulates the Linux system. This information suggests that the additional virtualization layer may hinder the performance of non-Linux operating systems hosting Docker containers. The paper presents a performance test of the Docker runtime on Linux, Microsoft Windows, and macOS. The test evaluated specific aspects of operating system performance on a MacBook computer with an {\texttimes}86/64 processor architecture. The experiment carried out examined the performance in terms of CPU speed, I/O speed, and network throughput. This test measured the efficiency of software that utilizes various system resources.},

  abstract = {Containerization is revolutionizing the way that many industries operate, provisioning major impact to modern computing technologies because it is extra lightweight, highly portable, energy, resource and storage efficient, cost-effective, performance efficient, and extremely quick during boot up. These often facilitate efficient load balancing, low-level system maintenance, server consolidation (for efficient energy and resource utilization) and replication of instances over geographical locations for better fault tolerance to escalate application reliability. However, some recent literature have addressed various challenges (such as complex networking, persistent storage facilities, cross data centers and multicloud supports, security issues, and lack of available, capable container management APIs, etc.) regarding successful container adoption in industries, which might have resulted in a seemingly meager increase in industrial deployments of containerization over the past few years despite bestowing efficient lightweight virtualization. Moreover, a comprehensive overview of containerizations along with their popularity dynamics has still not been found in contemporary literature, which further extends knowledge gap between developers and available technologies. Hence, current study touches upon different technicalities involved in containerization with potential problems and possible solutions along with various important industrial applications to manifest its existing supports and technical hardships. Finally, we have conducted a comprehensive experimental study to compare the performance of VMs, containers and unikernels in terms of CPU utilization, memory footprints, network bandwidth, execution time and technological maturity using standard benchmarks and observed containers to deliver satisfactory performance in almost all aspects, however, are still not free from issues regarding isolation \& security, performance stability, lack of available efficient tools for crossplatform support and persistent storage. Unikernels deliver good performance with VM-like isolation but still need to achieve desired technical maturity (in terms of microprocessor stability, process containment, persistent storage, etc.). VMs, on the other hand, are found to provide stable performance throughout, though bigger memory footprints and slower spin up/down remain their biggest weaknesses.},
